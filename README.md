## Repository Information

Respository's URL: [https://github.com/madishsn/wash-madishsn.git](https://github.com/madishsn/wash-madishsn.git)

This is a private repository for Saikrishna Madishetty to store all code from the course. The organization of this repository is as follows.



## Project Overview
- The first individual project entails using GitHub Pages (github.io) to create and launch a business profile website. The developer's qualifications, experiences, and educational background should all be fully represented on this website, which also includes a resume, contact details, and an extensive list of abilities. A link to a fresh HTML page introducing the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and associated practical projects should also be included on the website. The website needs to be both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. To guarantee a responsive design, it should make use of an open-source CSS template or framework like Bootstrap. The project's technical requirements include writing basic JavaScript code and adding multiple capabilities including an analog and digital clock as well as the ability to show and hide the developer's email by using jQuery and another open-source JavaScript framework or library. In order to improve the website's functionality and interaction, the project also needs to integrate two public Web APIs, such as jokeAPI and a public API with visuals. In order to provide a level of user involvement and customisation to the website, JavaScript cookies must be utilized to remember the client's initial visit and display a tailored message accordingly. The project's overall goals are to demonstrate the developer's proficiency in front-end web programming, demonstrate professionalism, and reach out to possible employers.
