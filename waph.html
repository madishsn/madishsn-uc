		<p> <b>Course Description </b> <br><br>
			Course consists of basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, CSS, Javascript) and back-end(PHP, MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced ands explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.

			<b>Labs overview</b><br><br>
			<ol>
			<li><i>Lab 0 </i> - Setting Up the Development Environment consists of two primary components: The first part of the course covers setting up an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine on the given online environment, installing required software, and cloning the course and private repositories. The second part includes performing git exercises and writing the report. The procedures for setting up the Ubuntu virtual machine on the CECH Sandbox and installing the necessary apps and software are described in Part I. There's also a screenshot showing the Apache Web Server running properly in the Ubuntu virtual machine. Part II covers creating and sharing a private repository on GitHub.com as well as how to clone the course repository into the virtual machine's home directory. A summary is given of the practical tasks, which include creating SSH keys, adding the public key to the GitHub account, cloning the remote repository into the virtual machine, and modifying the README.md file using the supplied template. Lastly, there's a screenshot showing that the modifications were successfully committed from the virtual machine to the remote repository. The lab report is organized using Markdown style and adheres to the template given in Lecture 2. It includes the student's name, email address, and headshot in addition to the course name and instructor. For ease of reading when grading, the report also contains clickable links to the lab folder on GitHub.com.</li> <br>
			<li><i>Lab 1 </i> - A thorough examination of the HTTP protocol and web application programming may be found in Lab 1: The Web and HTTP Protocol. In Part I, the lab explores using the Wireshark program to study the HTTP protocol. This includes using telnet to send simple HTTP requests and examining the responses that are returned. Part II covers the fundamentals of web application programming, including HTTP GET and POST requests, CGI web applications in C, and PHP. The lab report is organized using Markdown style and adheres to the template given in Lecture 2. It includes the student's name, email address, and headshot in addition to the course name and instructor. For ease of reading when grading, the report also contains clickable links to the lab folder on GitHub.com.</li> <br>

			<li><i>Lab 2 </i> - Focuses on honing practical skills in frontend web development. In the first task, participants create a foundational HTML page by incorporating essential tags and employing both inlined and external JavaScript to introduce interactive elements. The utilization of echo.php is emphasized to effectively handle GET and POST requests, highlighting the significance of server-side interaction. Moving on to Task 2, participants delve into Ajax, CSS (inline, internal, external), jQuery, and Web API integration. Various types of CSS are explored to provide diverse styling options. The second task also covers the implementation of async and await functions, along with the Fetch API, enabling participants to adeptly handle asynchronous operations and make HTTP requests. Overall, Lab 2 equips participants with comprehensive skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and essential web development tools for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.ions and making HTTP requests.</li>

		<b>Hackathons overview</b><br><br>
		<ol>
			<li><i>Hackathon 1 </i> - Hackathon focuses on opportunity to explore the particulars of online application security issues with an emphasis on identifying and addressing cross-site scripting(XSS) vulnerabilities provided by the Hackathon 1-Cross-Site Scripting Attacks and Defense. This hackathon contains two tasks: reflective XSS on the web application provided to participants - It is necessary to initiate a series of attacks. In step seven, the attacks increase in complexity, and participants must examine and identify underlying weaknessin each case. Then, participants should strengthen the weak rules of the previous labs by adding improved input validation and XSS defensive mechanisms. This process ends with the echo.php script and in rewriting the front-end prototype currently in use. participants knowledge of XSS attack vectors and practical skills to protect web applications from malicious exploits is enhanced through practical exercises and careful compliance, which also helps participants become more proficient in web security programming.</li>

		<b>Individual Project overview</b><br><br>

		<ol>
			<li><i>Project 1 </i> - The first individual project entails using GitHub Pages (github.io) to create and launch a business profile website. The developer's qualifications, experiences, and educational background should all be fully represented on this website, which also includes a resume, contact details, and an extensive list of abilities. A link to a fresh HTML page introducing the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and associated practical projects should also be included on the website. The website needs to be both aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. To guarantee a responsive design, it should make use of an open-source CSS template or framework like Bootstrap. The project's technical requirements include writing basic JavaScript code and adding multiple capabilities including an analog and digital clock as well as the ability to show and hide the developer's email by using jQuery and another open-source JavaScript framework or library. In order to improve the website's functionality and interaction, the project also needs to integrate two public Web APIs, such as jokeAPI and a public API with visuals. In order to provide a level of user involvement and customisation to the website, JavaScript cookies must be utilized to remember the client's initial visit and display a tailored message accordingly. The project's overall goals are to demonstrate the developer's proficiency in front-end web programming, demonstrate professionalism, and reach out to possible employers.</li>
